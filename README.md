Our goal is to streamline Cardano development and integration for Adobe Commerce and Magento 2 Open Source storefronts by developing a vast collection of REST API and GraphQL endpoints, enhancing developer experience and accelerating adoption. This is akin to baking in the functionality of Blockfrost into these two enterprise platforms. 

This repository was created as part of our open source commitment and is part of our Cardano Project Catalyst F12 proposal:

Adobe Commerce & Magento 2 Open Source Cardano DbSync Integration: Seamless REST & GraphQl APIs
